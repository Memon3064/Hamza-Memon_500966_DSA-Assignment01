The primary problem when it came to these tasks was adhering to the header files provided which were left empty. In order to implement these files, the "virtual" keyword was added before every function which essentially allows for the implementation of methods to be provided later via overriding. Inheritance was used to create child classes from the classes defined in the header file interfaces and the methods were then overridden in order to implement them, some with the "const" keyword to ensure that the original classes remained immutable. However, another problem arose as a result. When using the virtual keyword, the compiler creates a vtable which it needs to populate with the definitions of functions. However, we are not defining any functions only implementing them. So we need to begin our codes with dummy definitions that satisfies the compiler's vtable requirements
